# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript and enable type-aware lint rules. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

```sh
src
|
+-- app               # application layer containing:
|   |                 # this folder might differ based on the meta framework used
|   +-- routes        # application routes / can also be pages
|   +-- app.tsx       # main application component
|   +-- provider.tsx  # application provider that wraps the entire application with different global providers - this might also differ based on meta framework used
|   +-- router.tsx    # application router configuration
+-- assets            # assets folder can contain all the static files such as images, fonts, etc.
|
+-- components        # shared components used across the entire application
|
+-- config            # global configurations, exported env variables etc.
|
+-- features          # feature based modules
|
+-- hooks             # shared hooks used across the entire application
|
+-- lib               # reusable libraries preconfigured for the application
|
+-- stores            # global state stores
|
+-- testing           # test utilities and mocks
|
+-- types             # shared types used across the application
|
+-- utils             # shared utility functions
```

A feature could have the following structure:

```sh
src/features/awesome-feature
|
+-- api         # exported API request declarations and api hooks related to a specific feature
|
+-- assets      # assets folder can contain all the static files for a specific feature
|
+-- components  # components scoped to a specific feature
|
+-- hooks       # hooks scoped to a specific feature
|
+-- stores      # state stores for a specific feature
|
+-- types       # typescript types used within the feature
|
+-- utils       # utility functions for a specific feature
```
